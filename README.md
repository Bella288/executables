# executables
python executables (usable even if you don't have Python installed! Just download the zip for the one you want, unzip {extract} it, and run the exe file in it!)
Yes, all files are safe!
How to download:
1: Go to the zip file you want
2: Click "View Raw"
3: 
A short "What is it?" for each file:
guessnumgame: A number guessing game.
printingtime: A program that prints the time in different ways. Updates every second, and is synced to your timezone!
pyautoclicker: An autoclicker.
pydice: Prints a random number from 1 to 6
qrgen: A QR code generator.
recprint: A very nice receipt printer!
salestaxcalx: A program to calculate sales tax on an item. Just type in the original price, the abbreviation of the state you are in, and it gives you the price after sales tax!
ytdownloader: A program that saves YouTube videos from just entering the link (saves the file as the name of the video you downloaded, and stores it in the folder where you ran the EXE from)

I hope you enjoy these EXEs! Some more are on their way someday!
